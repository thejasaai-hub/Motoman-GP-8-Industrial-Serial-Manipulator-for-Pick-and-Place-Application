## APPARATUS REQUIRED
- Motoman GP8 industrial manipulator
- Teach pendant
- Objects for pick and place tasks

---

## THEORY
The Motoman GP8 is a versatile industrial robot with an 8 kg payload capacity, 727 mm reach, and six axes, 
making it ideal for high-speed assembly, packaging, and material handling. It features compact design, IP67 
wash-down protection, and advanced motion control for precise operations. With support for programming languages 
like INFORM III, C++, and Python, the GP8 offers flexibility and reliability in automating tasks across various industries.

## MY EXPERIENCE WITH AUTOMATING PICK AND PLACE OPERATIONS
Using the Motoman GP8, I automated the pick and place process by programming precise movements with the 
teach pendant. The setup included preparing the workspace, powering the robot, and programming it to pick 
and relocate objects efficiently. This project allowed me to explore real-world applications of robotics, 
enhance troubleshooting skills, and understand the impact of automation in industrial tasks.

## STEP-BY-STEP WORKING PROCEDURE

1. **Programming the Robot:** Created commands using the teach pendant for pick and place tasks.
2. **Preparing the Workspace:** Cleared obstacles and set up necessary tools.
3. **Powering On:** Activated the robot and controller.
4. **Positioning the Robot:** Moved to the starting position manually or via programming.
5. **Executing the Task:** Automated object picking, manipulation, and placement.
6. **Monitoring:** Ensured smooth operation and addressed any issues.
7. **Shutting Down:** Returned to the starting position and powered off.
